# Git Example
This a project for practicing git.
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code, it maintains the history and changes of our project. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaneously.

#Initializing our git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

#Git  Commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our projects's history. We can always revert back to a previous commit to undo changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project.

#Git and Github
Keep in mind that git and github are two different things. git is a version control software that can be used on your computer, certain text editors/idea and it's what github uses behind the scenes to maintain your code. Github is a remote service that holds your git repos.

#Git Braches
A branch is a separate version of our code, made fromma commit on adifferent branch(usually the main/master branch.)Changes on branches don't effect any other branchhes in our git repo, they are independant changes. We can merge changes into other branches when we want thouse changes all in one branch.
